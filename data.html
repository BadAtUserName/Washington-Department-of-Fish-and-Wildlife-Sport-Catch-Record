      <h2>Welcome to Our Journey</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Our journey started with a simple idea: to create something meaningful and impactful. What is currently more important than the world around us that we interact with everyday, even if you don't find youself fishing you might find this idea interesting. While talking to my boss one day she brought up that she fishes, and in that brought up the need for a better way to track the fish being caught as sometimes the piece of paper you are required to fill out in washingto state for sport catches can be unreliablle.<br>
      I built this with people and useability in mind. We have all lost things, but it is unlikely that you would lose your portable interent device. We thought we could streamline the process a bit, make it easier to log the fish one catches. Which you can update as you go just like you would paper. Not only can you track the fish you have caught, but if you internt device travels amongst your group you can see how you compare to your peers. Better yet, your internet device travels with something that may not be yours, like boat you may have rented, you can see how your catches stack up to others, and in this we as a group can be more concious of if we are or are not overfishing an area.<br>
      That is truly what this project is about, is conservation.
