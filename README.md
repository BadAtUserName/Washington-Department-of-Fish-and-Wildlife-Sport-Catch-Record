As a fisher person I want way to keep track of the fish and crab that I have in a way that is easier to not lose than paper. I would like like an update from the department of wildlife and game to prevent over fishing. 
2. As a fish ranger I want to a live update of the areas being fished and number of fish cause, in hopes of the department closing over fished areas early. 

3. As a researcher I want accurate and updated  data on the current fish population so I can keep track of current fishing patterns. 

4. As a client funding this project I want a webpage that includes a form that is easy to update that shows the current number of fish remaining and the current number of fish caught. 

5. As an art director I would like a page that is styled with the current Pantone color of the year so I can mark my portfolio each year at the beginning with a new color.

A website to report to the deparment of wildllife and game of washington the number of fish/crab caught.
